# The Question

![diagram1](https://github.com/WilliamAmbrozic/Four-Magic-Eclipses/blob/master/screenshots/M4SWL%20(1).png)

These four ellipses represent four sets and all the possible ways they can intersect (a Venn diagram, in other words). There are 8 regions inside each ellipse, and 15 regions altogether.

Is it possible to assign the numbers 1 to 15 to the fifteen regions so that the sum of the numbers in each ellipse is the same?

The program outputs the values of each section of the eclipses in the following alphabetical form:

[A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O] 

Refer to the comments in the main file solve.c for further explanation.
